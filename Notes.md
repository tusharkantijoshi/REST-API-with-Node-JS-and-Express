! We will learn about creating a simple api (rest api) using node and express

* rest api across when you thought about getting data from a source on the internet such as facebook or github. let's say you're trying to find videos on youtube you open up youtube type something into a search bar and hit enter and then you see a list of videos about that search term a rest api works in a similar way you search for something and you get a list of results back from the service you're requesting from

* An api is an application programming interface it is a set of rules that allow programs to talk to each other the developer creates the api on the server and allows the client to talk to it
* rest determines how the api looks like it stands for representational state transfer. It is a set of rules that developers follow when they create their APIs
* CURD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update and Delete it is another set of rules we are going to follow while building our API.
* For example whenever we have a database of users we need to be able to create user accounts, get or read the profile details, update the profile details and finally delete an account

* Node.js is a javascript runtime and all that it does is it allows javascript to be run in places other than the chrome or other browsers we can run it in the console or in our terminal we're gonna use that to create server-side javascript applications
* Secondly we'll be using express. express is as you can see fast up opinionated minimalist web framework for node. express is going to help us create different routes for our api
* finally we'll be using postman, postman is going to help us make different requests to our apis so that we can test all of our endpoints
